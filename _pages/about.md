I am a Ph.D. Computer Science candidate at the [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lab, University of Illinois Chicago](https://nlp.lab.uic.edu/). My research primarily focuses on NLP applications in the healthcare and social media domains, understanding the latent patterns in the evolving narratives. I leverage clinical knowledge graphs with machine learning models to estimate individual health trajectories. I'm also interested in understanding how the differences in the communication patterns of different demographic groups lead to polarized communities on social networks and what interventions can mitigate this. A strand of my research also explores effective communication of health-related insights by summarizing health answers in informal community question-answering forums using task-specific fine-tuning of neural language models. Previously, I worked as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Keshav Mahavidyalaya, University of Delhi, and as an Associate Software Engineer at Objective Systems Integrators before that. I hold a Masters in Computer Applications from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, India.
