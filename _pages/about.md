I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lab, University of Illinois Chicago](https://nlp.lab.uic.edu/). My research focuses on NLP applications in the healthcare and social media domains, specifically, for understanding the latent patterns within the evolving narratives. I aim to model precise individual health trajectories integrating clinical notes with medical knowledge graphs. One aspect of my research delves into understanding how the differences in the communication patterns across demographic groups lead to polarized communities on social networks and studying potential interventions to mitigate such polarization. Another strand of my research involves the effective communication of health-related insights. I achieve this by summarizing health answers in informal community question-answering forums employing task-specific fine-tuning of neural language models. 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Keshav Mahavidyalaya, University of Delhi, and held the position of Associate Software Engineer at Objective Systems Integrators. I hold a Masters in Computer Applications and Bachelors in Physics.
