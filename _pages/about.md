I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lab, University of Illinois Chicago](https://nlp.lab.uic.edu/). My research primarily focuses on NLP applications in the healthcare and social media domains, investigating the latent temporal patterns in the evolving narratives. 

I'm leveraging clinical notes over multiple patient visits to predict future health risks such as Type 2 Diabetes. I want to develop intelligent systems that can learn the patterns of progression of symptoms, interventions, and complications from this unstructured source. This is especially challenging in the clinical domain due to variations in language use, high use of abbreviations, and clinical jargon by different health professionals. My work focuses on exploring innovative approaches to address these challenges, particularly by integrating linguistic and medical knowledge graphs with neural language models for precise modeling and analyses. 

A strand of my research also explores effective communication of health-related insights by summarizing health answers in informal community question-answering forums. This work leverages task-specific fine-tuning of several language models for tasks ranging from sentence pair matching, classification, and summarization. I'm also interested in understanding how the differences in the communication patterns of different demographic groups lead to polarized communities on social networks and what interventions can mitigate this. My overarching research goals are to develop a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and contribute to social good.

Previously, I worked as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Keshav Mahavidyalaya, University of Delhi, and as an Associate Software Engineer at Objective Systems Integrators prior to that. I hold a Master's in Computer Applications from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, and a Bachelor's in Physics from the University of Delhi, India.
