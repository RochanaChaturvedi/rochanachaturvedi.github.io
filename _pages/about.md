I recently defended my Ph.D. dissertation at the [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lab, University of Illinois Chicago](https://nlp.lab.uic.edu/). My research focuses on NLP applications for social good, spanning clinical informatics and computational social science domains. My dissertation advances clinical temporal relation extraction, and introduces novel methods for multi-document temporal reasoning for early Type 2 Diabetes detection by integrating graph neural networks, language models, and external knowledge bases. Besides clinical NLP, I'm passionate about examining human behavior and societal dynamicsâ€” investigating challenges such as identity inference, social-media polarization and mitigation strategies, covert gender disparities in large language models and their labor market implications, as well as enhacing robustness in their responses.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Keshav Mahavidyalaya, University of Delhi, and worked as an Associate Software Engineer at Objective Systems Integrators. I hold Master's degrees in Computer Science and Computer Applications, and a Bachelor's in Physics.
